# Obsidian Plugin

This repository contains a starter template for developing an Obsidian plugin using TypeScript.

## Development

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Use `npm run dev` to build the plugin in watch mode.
3. Run `npm run build` to create a production build in the `dist/` folder.

The compiled plugin files (`manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css`) are placed in `dist/`. Copy this folder to your Obsidian vault's plugin directory to load the plugin.
